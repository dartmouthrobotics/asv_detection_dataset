# ASV Detection Data
This repo conatins
* sample scenes of LiDAR dataset collected by Catabot in Dartmouth Robobotics lab.
* The format includes .pcd format files of raw point clouds and representative labelled point cloud used by https://github.com/Hitachi-Automotive-And-Industry-Lab/semantic-segmentation-editor
* The collected data covers fresh/salt waters and different objects in the maritime domain.

    * Catabot ASV in Dartmouth Robotics and clustered point cloud
